## Part 1 - Recovering a True Model (Beginner Level)

We believe the true model to be...

$$
  Y_i = \underbrace{...}_\text{The True Model} + \epsilon_i
$$

And estimate that model by...

$$
  \hat{Y}_i = ...
$$

with our estimate of $\sigma$ as ...

```{r}

```


## Part 2 - Recovering a True Model (Intermediate Level)

We believe the true model to be...

$$
  Y_i = \underbrace{...}_\text{The True Model} + \epsilon_i
$$

And estimate that model by...

$$
  \hat{Y}_i = ...
$$

with our estimate of $\sigma$ as ...

```{r}

```



## Part 3 - Recovering a True Model (Advanced Level)

We believe the true model to be...

$$
  Y_i = \underbrace{...}_\text{The True Model} + \epsilon_i
$$

And estimate that model by...

$$
  \hat{Y}_i = ...
$$

with our estimate of $\sigma$ as ...

```{r}

```
