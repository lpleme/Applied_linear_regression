## Background

Here is a data table showing the available approved housing apartment options at BYU-Idaho for single students. There are 122 entries comprising 57 female and 65 male apartment options.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Code to get you started. 
# Only the first 100 observations are shown here because the dataset is really too big to show all of it in a markdown file.
datatable(Rent, options=list(lengthMenu = c(3,10,30)), extensions="Responsive")
```


<!-- Write a few statements here that introduce the data table showing apartments for only your gender. -->

```{r}
# Use this R-chunk to...
# ...filter this data set down to show only your gender's apartment options. Use the R-chunk below to do this. Call your new data set `Rentf` if you are a female or `Rentm` if you are a male. Then show the new data table using the `datatable(...)` function. -->
